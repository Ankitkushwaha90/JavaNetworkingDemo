You asked for Stop-and-Wait (SNW) Protocol implementation in Java — with:

## Sender

## Receiver

## Input/Output

Properly handled TCP connection and Acknowledgement (ACK) mechanism.

I'll write it very clearly for easy understanding ✅.

### 📜 Java Program — Stop-and-Wait Protocol (SNW)
## 1. Sender.java
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Sender {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        final int PORT = 6000;
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);
        System.out.println("Sender is running and waiting for Receiver to connect...");

        Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
        System.out.println("Receiver connected!");

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));

        System.out.print("Enter the number of frames to send: ");
        int totalFrames = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // consume leftover newline

        for (int frame = 0; frame < totalFrames; frame++) {
            System.out.println("Sending frame: " + frame);
            out.println(frame); // Send frame

            String ack = in.readLine(); // Wait for ACK
            if (ack != null && ack.equals("ACK" + frame)) {
                System.out.println("Acknowledgment received for frame: " + frame);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Acknowledgment failed for frame: " + frame);
                frame--; // Resend same frame
            }
        }

        System.out.println("All frames sent successfully!");

        // Closing everything
        socket.close();
        serverSocket.close();
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
### 2. Receiver.java
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Receiver {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        final String SERVER = "localhost"; // or Server IP
        final int PORT = 6000;

        Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER, PORT);
        System.out.println("Connected to Sender!");

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

        while (true) {
            String receivedFrame = in.readLine();

            if (receivedFrame == null) {
                break;
            }

            System.out.println("Received frame: " + receivedFrame);

            // Send ACK
            out.println("ACK" + receivedFrame);
            System.out.println("Sent acknowledgment: ACK" + receivedFrame);
        }

        System.out.println("All frames received successfully!");
        socket.close();
    }
}
```
### 🖥️ Sample Input/Output
## ➡️ Sender side
```bash
> javac Sender.java
> java Sender
Sender is running and waiting for Receiver to connect...
Receiver connected!
Enter the number of frames to send: 5
Sending frame: 0
Acknowledgment received for frame: 0
Sending frame: 1
Acknowledgment received for frame: 1
Sending frame: 2
Acknowledgment received for frame: 2
Sending frame: 3
Acknowledgment received for frame: 3
Sending frame: 4
Acknowledgment received for frame: 4
All frames sent successfully!
```
### ➡️ Receiver side
```bash
> javac Receiver.java
> java Receiver
Connected to Sender!
Received frame: 0
Sent acknowledgment: ACK0
Received frame: 1
Sent acknowledgment: ACK1
Received frame: 2
Sent acknowledgment: ACK2
Received frame: 3
Sent acknowledgment: ACK3
Received frame: 4
Sent acknowledgment: ACK4
All frames received successfully!
```
### 🔥 How It Works?

Step	Explanation
Sender	Sends 1 frame, waits for ACK
Receiver	Receives frame, sends back ACK
If ACK received	Sender sends next frame
If ACK not received (simulated)	Sender resends frame
After all frames	Both sides close
### ✅ Important Points
Stop-and-Wait = send one frame, wait for ACK, then next frame.

ACK loss simulation is simple (can be extended if you want).

Reliable delivery guaranteed via acknowledgment.

### ⚡ Bonus
If you want, I can also provide a version that randomly drops ACKs to simulate errors and resend frames automatically!

Would you like that advanced error simulation version also? 🚀
(It's very good for understanding how SNW handles packet loss!)
