Here’s the full Input and Output description for your Java programs (Client.java and MyServer.java) for connection establishment:

## 📋 Question:
Write a Java program for connection establishment between client and server.

## 🖥️ Java Programs:
### Server Side — MyServer.java
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class MyServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(6666);
            Socket s = ss.accept();

            DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());
            String str = dis.readUTF();

            System.out.println("Message = " + str);

            dis.close();
            s.close();
            ss.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
}
```
### Client Side — Client.java
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Socket s = new Socket("localhost", 6666);
            DataOutputStream dout = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());

            dout.writeUTF("Hello Server");
            dout.flush();
            dout.close();
            s.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
}
```
## 📥 Input:
There is no manual input from the user during runtime.
The client automatically sends the message "Hello Server" to the server.

## 📤 Output (on Server Side):
When you run the server program, and then run the client program, the server will print:

```ini
Message = Hello Server
```
(Server receives and displays the message sent by client.)

### 📦 Summary Table:

Aspect	Description
Input	Client automatically sends message "Hello Server"
Output (on Server)	Message = Hello Server
✅ So your program establishes the connection, sends a message, and receives it — exactly as required!

Would you also like me to show a diagram 🧩 that explains visually how connection flow happens?
