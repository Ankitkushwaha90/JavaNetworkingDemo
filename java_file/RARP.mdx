Let's write a Java program to simulate RARP (Reverse ARP Protocol).

## ðŸ“– What is RARP?
RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol) is used when a device knows its MAC address but does not know its IP address.

The device sends a RARP request with its MAC address, and the server responds with the corresponding IP address.

âœ¨ Java Program: RARP Protocol Simulation
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RARPSimulation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a HashMap to store MAC -> IP mapping
        HashMap<String, String> rarpTable = new HashMap<>();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 2: Input the number of entries
        System.out.print("Enter the number of RARP table entries: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline character

        // Step 3: Input MAC and IP address pairs
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter MAC address " + i + ": ");
            String mac = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.print("Enter IP address " + i + ": ");
            String ip = scanner.nextLine();
            rarpTable.put(mac, ip);
        }

        // Step 4: Display the RARP table
        System.out.println("\n--- RARP Table ---");
        for (String mac : rarpTable.keySet()) {
            System.out.println("MAC Address: " + mac + " -> IP Address: " + rarpTable.get(mac));
        }

        // Step 5: Search for an IP address based on MAC
        System.out.print("\nEnter MAC address to search for IP address: ");
        String searchMac = scanner.nextLine();

        // Step 6: Lookup and output
        if (rarpTable.containsKey(searchMac)) {
            System.out.println("The IP address for MAC " + searchMac + " is: " + rarpTable.get(searchMac));
        } else {
            System.out.println("IP address for MAC " + searchMac + " not found in RARP table.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
## âœ… Example Input/Output
Input:

```ruby
Enter the number of RARP table entries: 2
Enter MAC address 1: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01
Enter IP address 1: 192.168.1.10
Enter MAC address 2: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02
Enter IP address 2: 192.168.1.20
```
RARP Table:

```ruby
--- RARP Table ---
MAC Address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 -> IP Address: 192.168.1.10
MAC Address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 -> IP Address: 192.168.1.20
```
Search:

```ruby
Enter MAC address to search for IP address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02
```
Output:

```ruby
The IP address for MAC AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 is: 192.168.1.20
```
###ðŸš€ Key Points:
HashMap<String, String> is used here for MAC â†’ IP mapping.

Very similar to the ARP simulation, but reverse direction.

Good for practical lab programs and exam practice!

Would you also like me to show you a combined ARP + RARP simulation Java program? (both in one!) ðŸš€
It would be very useful if you want an even better and bigger project! ðŸŽ¯
Shall I show it? ðŸŒŸ
