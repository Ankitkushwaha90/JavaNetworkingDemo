Here’s a simple Java program using TCP Sockets where:

Server sends current Date and Time to the Client.

Client receives and displays it.

### ✅ Full program ✅ Clear input/output ✅ TCP socket-based communication.

## 📜 Java Code
### 1. Server.java (Date and Time Server)
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.Date;

public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int PORT = 5000;

        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT)) {
            System.out.println("Server is running and waiting for a client...");

            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Client connected!");

            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

            // Send current Date and Time
            Date date = new Date();
            out.println("Current Date and Time: " + date.toString());

            System.out.println("Date and Time sent to client!");

            clientSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Server Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
### 2. Client.java (Receives Date and Time)
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final String SERVER = "localhost"; // Change IP if server on different machine
        final int PORT = 5000;

        try (Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER, PORT)) {
            System.out.println("Connected to server!");

            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));

            String serverMessage = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Server says: " + serverMessage);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Client Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
## 🖥️ Sample Input/Output
### ➡️ Server Side
```bash
> javac Server.java
> java Server
Server is running and waiting for a client...
Client connected!
Date and Time sent to client!
```
### ➡️ Client Side
```bash
> javac Client.java
> java Client
Connected to server!
Server says: Current Date and Time: Sun Apr 27 14:53:02 IST 2025
```
### ✅ Important Points
Server listens on port 5000.

Client connects to server on localhost (127.0.0.1).

Server sends the current Date and Time only once and closes.

You can modify it easily to send continuously if you want (ask me if you want that 🚀).

### 📢 How to run?
Open two terminals:

Terminal 1: run Server.java

Terminal 2: run Client.java

### ⚡ Bonus Idea
If you want, I can also give:

Server continuously sends date and time every second (live clock).

Client keeps receiving live date-time updates!
Would you like that advanced version too? 🚀✨
