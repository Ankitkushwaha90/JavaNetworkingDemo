Got it!
I'll give you a full Java program that implements Sliding Window Protocol — with:

Sender and Receiver,

Input/Output,

Window size handling,

And simulate frame transmission, ACK, lost frames, etc.

### 🛠 Java Program — Sliding Window Protocol (Sender + Receiver)
- Sender.java
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Sender {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        final int PORT = 5000;
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(PORT);
        System.out.println("Sender is running and waiting for Receiver to connect...");

        Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
        System.out.println("Receiver connected!");

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));

        System.out.print("Enter the number of frames to send: ");
        int totalFrames = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the window size: ");
        int windowSize = scanner.nextInt();

        int framesSent = 0;

        while (framesSent < totalFrames) {
            int framesToSendNow = Math.min(windowSize, totalFrames - framesSent);

            // Send frames
            for (int i = 0; i < framesToSendNow; i++) {
                System.out.println("Sending frame " + (framesSent + i));
                out.println(framesSent + i);  // Sending frame number
            }

            // Wait for Acknowledgment
            for (int i = 0; i < framesToSendNow; i++) {
                String ack = in.readLine();
                System.out.println("Acknowledgement received for frame: " + ack);
            }

            framesSent += framesToSendNow;
        }

        System.out.println("All frames sent successfully!");

        // Close connections
        socket.close();
        serverSocket.close();
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
### Receiver.java
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class Receiver {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        final String SERVER = "localhost"; // or server IP
        final int PORT = 5000;
        Socket socket = new Socket(SERVER, PORT);
        System.out.println("Connected to Sender!");

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);

        while (true) {
            String frame = in.readLine();

            if (frame == null) {
                break;
            }

            System.out.println("Received frame: " + frame);

            // Simulate correct reception and send ACK
            out.println(frame);
        }

        System.out.println("All frames received successfully!");

        // Close connections
        socket.close();
    }
}
```
### 📥 Input/Output Example
## ➡️ Sender Side
```bash
> javac Sender.java
> java Sender
Sender is running and waiting for Receiver to connect...
Receiver connected!
Enter the number of frames to send: 7
Enter the window size: 3
Sending frame 0
Sending frame 1
Sending frame 2
Acknowledgement received for frame: 0
Acknowledgement received for frame: 1
Acknowledgement received for frame: 2
Sending frame 3
Sending frame 4
Sending frame 5
Acknowledgement received for frame: 3
Acknowledgement received for frame: 4
Acknowledgement received for frame: 5
Sending frame 6
Acknowledgement received for frame: 6
All frames sent successfully!
```
### ➡️ Receiver Side
```bash
> javac Receiver.java
> java Receiver
Connected to Sender!
Received frame: 0
Received frame: 1
Received frame: 2
Received frame: 3
Received frame: 4
Received frame: 5
Received frame: 6
All frames received successfully!
```
### ✅ Key Points

Part	Explanation
Sender	Accepts number of frames, window size, and sends frames inside the window
Receiver	Receives frames and sends back ACK
ACK	After each frame, an acknowledgment is sent
Socket	TCP used for communication (guarantees delivery)
Window	Moves after all frames in the window are acknowledged
⚡ Extra (Optional)
If you want realistic errors, like:

Lost frames,

Resend on timeout,

Selective Repeat / Go-Back-N variants,

👉 I can give you an Advanced Sliding Window Simulation too!

Would you like a version that simulates lost frames and automatic resend (more realistic for red team / cybersecurity purpose)? 🚀
