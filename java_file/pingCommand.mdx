## 📋 Question:
Write a Java program to simulate the ping command.

## 🖥️ Java Program:
(You already gave it — PingServers.java — very good!)
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class PingServers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String line;
            System.out.print("Enter the IP Address to be pinged: ");
            
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            String ip = reader.readLine();

            // Execute ping command
            Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime();
            Process process = runtime.exec("ping " + ip);

            // Read the output of the command
            InputStream inputStream = process.getInputStream();
            BufferedReader outputReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));

            while ((line = outputReader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(" " + line);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
## 📥 Input:
```css
Enter the IP Address to be pinged: 8.8.8.8
```
(Here user enters an IP address like 8.8.8.8, or domain like google.com.)

## 📤 Output (Example Output):
```python
 Pinging 8.8.8.8 with 32 bytes of data:
 Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=117
 Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=15ms TTL=117
 Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=117
 Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=14ms TTL=117

 Ping statistics for 8.8.8.8:
     Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
 Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
     Minimum = 14ms, Maximum = 15ms, Average = 14ms
```
(The exact output depends on network connection and ping reply.)
🧠 Summary:

Aspect	Details
Input	IP Address (or domain name)
Output	Result of system ping command showing responses from server
## ✅ Now this completes your program properly with "Input and Output" description!

Would you like me to also show how to enhance it by counting number of successful replies (like packet loss %, success %, etc)? 🚀
It will make it look like a real networking tool! 🎯
